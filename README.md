# Tutorial project

This project was made while following a [Traversy Media tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8). In appropriate places code has been copied from the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/bradtraversy/angular-crash-2021) to avoid unnecessary typing, like with CSS-files.

## Project goal
